# A scene must export the following symbols

# <filename>
# - asciiz string, including the ".bmp" extension
# <image.width>
# - unsigned word
# <image.height>
# - unsigned word

# <camera>
# four 3-vectors of doubles
# - location
# - direction
# - right (Length of vector = width of frame)
# - up (Length of vector = height of frame)
# - word 0,1,2,3,4,5 -> Camera X,Y,Z
# - word 6,7,8,9,10,11 -> Corner X,Y,Z
# - word 12,13,14,15,16,17 -> Right X,Y,Z
# - word 18,19,20,21,22,23 -> Up X,Y,Z

# <objects> (Allocate 22 Words for each object)
# linked list. pointer in word 0; data follows
# - word 0 -> next <objects> node or 0
# - word 1 -> type
# - word 2,3 -> ColorR
# - word 4,5 -> ColorG
# - word 6,7 -> ColorB
# - word 8 -> Reflectivity
# - word 9 -> Shininess
# - subsequent words type-specific

# <lights>
# - null-terminated list of pairs
# - each pair has 3-vectors for position and color
# - word 0 -> next light (or 0)
# - word 2,3 -> X Position
# - word 4,5 -> Y Position
# - word 6,7 -> Z Position
# - word 8,9 -> R
# - word 10,11 -> G
# - word 12,13 -> B

# Entities that are not exported

# Rays
# - words 0,1,2,3,4,5 -> Point from which the ray starts
# - words 6,7,8,9,10,11 -> Unit Vector in Direction of Ray

# the type of an object is
# - 0 = sphere
# - fields position, radius (8 Words total)
# - 1 = plane
# - fields point on plane, normal (12 Words total)
